# Hello everyone, I'm John Ernest Lim! ðŸ‘‹

I am interested about database management and coding, which led me to pursue the BS Information Technology course. I'm also passionate about learning and sharing knowledge with other people. 

My tech journey started when I came across a video in which a skilled programmer created his own version of a popular game, which sparked my interest in programming and coding.
